    "### Step 1. Formalized Task\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing an algorithm for the problem of predicting a survivor on the Titanic, we will be guided by the principle of model interpretability. This means that we will choose algorithms that make it easy to understand which factors influence survival prediction and how much.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, linear regression is one of the most interpretable algorithms, as it allows you to evaluate the impact of each of the factors on survival. If we see that simplifying the model to linear regression does not lead to a significant deterioration in the results, then we will use this algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we see that simplifying the model to linear regression leads to a significant deterioration in the results, then we will use more complex algorithms, such as gradient boosting or neural networks. At the same time, we will take into account that the results of these algorithms may be less interpretable and require additional analysis and verification before making decisions based on these results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, when choosing an algorithm for a problem, we will pay special attention to the interpretability of the model and use more complex algorithms only if simplifying the model leads to worse results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the formalized task at the first stage of the primary model selection is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model** with k features:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a(x) = w_0 + w_1x^1 + \\dots w_kx^k = \\langle w, x \\rangle,\\\\\n",
